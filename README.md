# teamSummary

Generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee. Include tests to aid in making the code maintainable, all unit tests should pass before deployment.

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

### User input

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

### Roster output

The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)



* The URL of the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Findjules2/teamSummary

* Updated Portfolio
https://findjules2.github.io/bootstrapPortfolio/
